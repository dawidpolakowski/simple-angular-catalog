# simple-angular-catalog Application


## Overview

Build an interactive user directory
Create an interface that allows a user to view user data (sample data is attached). The interface should allow a visitor to browse a list of names and then select an item to view more information.
Goal
 
To determine your development proficiency and creativity when creating a solution to a problem from the ground up.
Output Requirements
 
A single, HTML page with no server side logic (all state must be managed by JS)
The sample data must be fetched using Javascript (i.e. to simulate an API)
The page must be styled beyond what is provided by simply a CSS framework (if you are using one). Eg. If you are using Bootstrap, we shouldnt be able to tell visually that it is Bootstrap.
Use package managers for any front end dependencies you may need
The page must employ URI routing to allow deep linking to users and provide resiliency to page refreshes
A Readme file should be included with instructions on how to install and view the project.
Browser requirements:
Chrome latest
IE9
iOS 8 / iPhone 6S
Android 5 / Galaxy s6

Additional features you may consider:
 
Search
Google map to show address location
View state transition/animation
Notes
 
Prioritise clarity over cleverness
Ensure your JS and CSS is organised and clear
You can use any frameworks of your choosing, however, ensure you can justify your decisions
Delivery
Your code should be delivered as a zip file via email
Your zip package should contain all code, assets and installation instructions (if needed) in order to download packages.
