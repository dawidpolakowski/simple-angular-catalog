        <h2>Overview</h2>
         Build an interactive user directory Create an interface that allows a user to view user data (sample data is attached). The interface should allow a visitor to browse a list of names and then select an item to view more information. Goal To determine
        your development proficiency and creativity when creating a solution to a problem from the ground up. Output Requirements A single, HTML page with no server side logic (all state must be managed by JS) The sample data must be fetched using Javascript
        (i.e. to simulate an API) The page must be styled beyond what is provided by simply a CSS framework (if you are using one). Eg. If you are using Bootstrap, we shouldnt be able to tell visually that it is Bootstrap. Use package managers for any
        front end dependencies you may need The page must employ URI routing to allow deep linking to users and provide resiliency to page refreshes A Readme file should be included with instructions on how to install and view the project. Browser requirements:
        Chrome latest IE9 iOS 8 / iPhone 6S Android 5 / Galaxy s6 Additional features you may consider: Search Google map to show address location View state transition/animation Notes Prioritise clarity over cleverness Ensure your JS and CSS is organised
        and clear You can use any frameworks of your choosing, however, ensure you can justify your decisions Delivery Your code should be delivered as a zip file via email Your zip package should contain all code, assets and installation instructions
        (if needed) in order to download packages.
